                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended
                    for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its
                        Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                        elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                        navigation. </li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript
                        on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                        database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application,
                        or
                        perform file manipulations on a server. </li>
                </ul>

                <header>what you should already know</header>
                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). </li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on
                        the
                        main page about JavaScript. </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="hello_world" class="main-section">
                <header>hello world</header>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript
                    code: </p>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
greetMe("World");</code>
            </section>

            <section id="variables" class="main-section">
                <header>variables</header>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules. </p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase). </p>
                <p> You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode
                    escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99,
                    and
                    _name. </p>
            </section>

            <section id="if_else_statement" class="main-section">
                <header>if else statement</header>
                <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else
                    clause
                    to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows: </p>
                <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of
                    what
                    evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                    statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested
                    if
                    statements. </p>

                <p> You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence,
                    as
                    follows: </p>
                <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
statement_last; }</code>

                <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be
                    executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
                    general,
                    it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements: </p>
                <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
</code>

                <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can
                    be
                    confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code: </p>
                <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>

                <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional
                    parentheses around the assignment. For example: </p>
                <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
